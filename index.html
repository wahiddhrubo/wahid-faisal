  <!-- About Me Section -->
  <div class="content-section">
    <p>I am <b>Wahid Faisal</b>, a fourth-year undergraduate student pursuing Industrial and Production Engineering at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology. My research interests focus on the <b>intersection of Machine Learning, Digital Twin Technology, and Optimization in Industrial Applications. </b>I am currently involved with the <b><a href="https://ciol-researchlab.github.io/" target="_blank">Computational Intelligence and Operations Laboratory (CIOL)</a></b>, where my work centers on developing AI-driven solutions for industrial production, with a strong focus on optimization and operational efficiency.</br>
   </p> 
    <p>Before joining the CIOL, I built a strong foundation as a freelancer on Upwork, where I honed my coding and problem-solving skills by working with clients from various industries. Over the course of <b>19 completed projects</b>, I consistently delivered high-quality results, earning a<b> 100% Job Success rate.</b> This experience allowed me to refine my coding expertise in areas like machine learning, optimization, and digital twins and managing project deadlines.</p>
    <b>I am currently seeking opportunities in Machine Learning, Digital Twin Technology, and Optimization in industrial production.</b> I am known for being a fast learner, highly adaptable, and experienced in managing projects and collaborating with teams. I enjoy tackling new challenges, sharing knowledge, and continuously expanding my skillset to explore innovative solutions.</p>
